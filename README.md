# Expo X Zustand X Supabase Menu CRUD App

This is an Expo powered React Native application integrated with Zustand and Supabase database as a prototype to a restaurant's menu system
This application was made as a Midterm examination Project, bear with me, im very new to this

FEATURES:
= Staff Login with Supabase Auth
= CRUD Operations on menu items
= Navigation using Expo
= Themed UI based on the restaurant

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository, or download it

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fake-Aaron/MidtermMenus.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. In the event that the project isnt linked to the Supabase i have (or doesnt work anymore):
= Create a new project at Supabase
= Copy your project url and anon/public key
= Update /lib/supabase.ts file, and change the url and key to your project

After this, you may populate the data from supabase, or from the app itself. make sure to add a user on supabase first

IMPORTANT NOTE: The code for staffLogin.tsx does NOT have a register button. This is done to emulate the fact that restaurants do not use register buttons in app. They usually have a tech expert making your account. If you need or want to access the CRUD functions from the staffPanel, Please contact me (Discord: fake_aaron) to help you set up an authenticated account.
